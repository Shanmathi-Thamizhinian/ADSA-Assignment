<h1>OPTIMIZED EVACUATION ROUTES FOR DISASTER-PRONE AREAS USING QUADTREE</h1>

<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

The goal of this project is to create an efficient pathfinding system using the
geospatial indexing and quadtrees to find the optimal routes for evacuation in
areas that are prone to natural disasters. This approach will use spatial data
structures and heuristic search algorithms to guide people to safety during
emergencies such as floods. The system will integrate quadtrees for spatial
partitioning and A* for pathfinding to identify the shortest and safest evacuation
routes while taking into account obstacles, terrain features, and real-time
conditions. This innovative solution aims to enhance disaster preparedness and
response efforts by providing communities facing natural disasters with timely
and reliable evacuation guidance.
